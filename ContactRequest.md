Hi there! This is a bit of an unorthodox way of reaching out to the open source community for CDDA, but here goes!

I'm running [a podcast about roguelike games](https://grogpod.zone) and plan on covering CDDA in a few weeks. I've been doing some cursory level of journalist research about CDDA and have been finding the recent Steam release very interesting. I'm reaching out because you are one of the top contributors to the project over the past year-ish, and I thought you could provide some valuable insight on the topic. I have some questions that I'd love to get your input on, if you have the time. I can leave your feedback as anonymous as well if you prefer so.

* As one of the top contributors of CDDA, were you aware of any plans to have KorgGenT place the game for commercial release on Steam?
* Are you aware of any revenue-sharing plans from the Steam release to be shared amongst the contributors of the project?
* Where do you see CDDA development in the next 1-2 years as a result of the Steam release?


Thanks for your time and thank you for your continued work in the open source community :-)
